# Directors’ Review

The Directors are pleased to announce the results of the Company for the period ended March 31, 2024.

# OPERATIONAL & FINANCIAL REVIEW

Production and sales figures for the nine months period ended March 31, 2024 are as follows:

| |Jul-Mar. 2024 Tons|Jul-Mar. 2023 Tons|
|---|---|---|
|Clinker Production|1,760,696|1,476,010|
|Cement Production|1,046,054|1,171,569|
|Cement Dispatches - Local|948,511|1,033,057|
|Cement Dispatches - Export|95,568|134,602|
|Cement Dispatches|1,044,079|1,167,659|
|Clinker Dispatches - Export|725,636|310,936|
|Total Dispatches|1,769,715|1,478,595|
|Clinker Capacity Utilization|81%|68%|

# Industry Review

During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, total cement dispatches (domestic and exports) were 34.5 million tons, which is 2.7% higher than the same period last year. Domestic dispatches were 29.4 million tons, showing a decline of 3.9%, while exports rose by 70.0% to 5.1 million tons. The industry-wide capacity utilization was recorded at 56%.

# Sales Review

Local cement sales remained stagnant due to uncertain political & economic conditions. ACPL's volumetric sales declined by around 8% during the period under review. The company was able to export higher quantities of clinker and cement, achieving an overall capacity utilization of around 81%.

# Financial Review

The net sales revenue of the company grew by Rs 3.3 billion (18%) over the corresponding period. The production cost increased by Rs. 116 per ton (1%) compared to the same period last year. The increase in production cost was partially passed on to local market consumers through price increases.

Third Quarter Report 2024
# Quarterly Report - Attock Cement Pakistan Limited


Accordingly, net retention of cement in the local market increased by 11% over the corresponding period. However, the prices in the international market remained under pressure due to stiff competition from other players in the regional markets.

Accordingly, the gross margins reduced to 19% from 21%, and operating margins reduced to 6% from 11% as compared to the same period last year.

As reported earlier, the company has recognized a sum of Rs. 2,196 million in the financial statement of the 1Q 2023-24 on account of divestment which represents exchange difference, non-competition fee, and consideration for the loss of majority control as referred to in note 12 of the accounts.

Consequently, the overall net profit after tax has been reported at Rs. 2,219 million.

# Commercial Production from Line-IV

By the grace of Almighty Allah, the commercial production from Line – IV has commenced with effect from April 16, 2024. The new line has the total installed cement production capacity of 1,275,000 tons per annum.

# Wind Mill Project

As part of the company’s strategy to keep checks on the rising power cost, the company is installing a Wind Mill of 4.8 MW at its plant for captive power generation. An EPC contract has already been signed, and a letter of credit has been established in March 2024. The project implementation timeline is around 10-12 months.

# Future Outlook

Economic instability poses a formidable challenge to the country’s development and prosperity. The country grapples with myriad economic issues including skyrocketing inflation, higher interest rates, alarming debt burden, and economic growth slowing to a meager 2%. Addressing these economic challenges, the incumbent government will require comprehensive reforms aimed at improving fiscal management, enhancing revenue generation, promoting exports led growth, speedy privatization of State-Owned Enterprises, and attracting foreign investments in various segments of the economy.

The country’s economic stability is contingent upon its ability to secure the extended new IMF program. The immediate challenge for the new Government will be the conclusion of a new program as soon as possible so that economic uncertainty is cleared and both the economic managers of the country and Pakistan’s corporate sector have a clear idea about the future course of actions.

The consumption-led growth is largely dependent upon the interest rates. If the Central Bank continues to observe tight monetary policy, then investment in the local real estate sector shall remain subdued, and as a result, the desired level of volumetric growth in cement dispatches may not be achieved.

Your Management is assessing the situation regularly and adopting measures to keep the rising costs under control through initiating cost-saving projects and adopting austerity measures in day-to-day operations.

# Acknowledgment

The Company deeply acknowledges and recognizes the efforts put in by both the management and non-management staff and offers its sincere thanks for their continuous support. The company also recognizes the cooperation that it is constantly receiving from both Federal and Provincial Governments, local administration, law enforcing agencies, regulatory bodies, customers, bankers, and suppliers.
